# ix-lisbon-project-week-1

Here is the repo with the project brief and where you should push your final poker game .py file. Might be a good idea to edit this README to include a link to your blog (where in a post you should link this repo too) :) 

The deadline is **tomorrow (Friday) the 31st of May at 8pm**.

Blog is live and has a great picture of Lisbon, but it is missing an explanation of how the poker_game.py file works.

The poker_game.py file also doesn't execute when called in the terminal - when looking at the code, it does however look like a lot of effort and thinking went into it's production.
